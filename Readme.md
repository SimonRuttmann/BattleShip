## 🛠️ It is a BattleShip – A tactical journey!

The goal was to recreate the classic *Schiffe versenken* (Battleship) experience with a fresh digital twist.  
Here’s how the project came to life:

### 🔧 Gameplay Features

- 🧠 **Singleplayer vs. AI** (normal/hard mode)
- 🤖 **AI vs. AI simulation**
- 🌍 **Multiplayer via network** – act as Host or Client
- 💾 **Game saving & loading**
- 🎯 **Custom grid sizes** (5x5 to 30x30)
- 🛥️ Ship sizes: 2, 3, 4, and 5

### 🕹️ Game Modes

#### 🎮 Singleplayer

- Choose difficulty
- Place ships manually via drag & drop – or go random
- Intelligent enemy AI that adapts with difficulty

#### 🧠 AI vs. AI

Sit back and let the machines battle it out. A perfect way to test and compare AI behaviors.

#### 🌐 Multiplayer

- **Host:** configure grid and ships
- **Client:** connect via IP
- Play directly or let an AI fight for you

### 💾 Save & Load

- Save games during your turn
- Resume from any saved state
- Works for both **singleplayer** and **multiplayer**

## 🎨 User Interface

A lot of love went into keeping the UI intuitive and clean.  
Designed with keyboard/mouse control in mind, users can:

- Navigate menus easily via mouse
- Use sliders & buttons with drag & drop
- Customize game settings quickly
